MGSC 695 - Optimization for Data Science

Please don't modify the existing file structure within this .zip file or the code won't run properly.

This submission contains:
1. A .pdf file with my explanations for the homework problems.
2. A .ipynb file containing my python code for the second problem.
3. A folder that contains the dataset given for this assignment.

If you have issues, please let me know.

Alternatively, this can be accessed from a GitHub repository I have set up for the same purpose. This repo also has the markdown code I used to write the .pdf file:
